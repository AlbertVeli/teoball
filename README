Teoball
=======

Basic bouncing ball example using pygame_sdl2.
Change pygame_sdl2 to pygame at the top of the two python
files to use the old pygame (that uses SDL-1.2). The reason
I switched to pygame_sdl2 is that it worked better with OSX.

The sprite and sound loading functions are taken from the chimp.py
example that comes with pygame.

 https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/chimp.py.html

Purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to get a sprite on
screen and play a sound with pygame.

Drop any mp3 into the resources directory and name it bgmusic.mp3
to play background music. Note, SDL2_mixer must have mp3 support
for this to work.

Install
=======

First install libsdl2, sdl2-mixer (with mp3-support), sdl2-image
and sdl2-ttf with your package manager of choice. Then:

git clone https://github.com/renpy/pygame_sdl2.git
cd pygame_sdl2
python3 setup.py build
python3 setup.py install --user

If using OSX and brew, skip --user.
