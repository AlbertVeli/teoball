Teoball

Bouncing ball example using pygame_sdl2.
Change pygame_sdl2 to pygame at the top of the two files
to use the old pygame (sdl1.2).

The sprite and sound loading functions are taken from the chimp.py
example that comes with pygame.

Purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to get a sprite on
screen and play a sound with pygame.

Drop any mp3 into the resources directory and name it bgmusic.mp3
to play background music. Note, SDL2_mixer must have mp3 support
for this to work.
