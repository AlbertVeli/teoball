Basic bouncing ball example using pygame_sdl2.
Change pygame_sdl2 to pygame at the top of the two python
files to use the old pygame (that uses SDL-1.2). The reason
I switched to pygame_sdl2 is that it worked better with OSX.

The sprite and sound loading functions are taken from the chimp.py
example that comes with pygame.

 https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/chimp.py.html

Purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to get a sprite on
screen and play a sound with pygame.

Drop any mp3 into the resources directory and name it bgmusic.mp3
to play background music. Note, SDL2_mixer must have mp3 support
for this to work.

Install prerequisites
=====================

First install libsdl2, sdl2-mixer (with mp3-support), sdl2-image
and sdl2-ttf with your package manager of choice.

gentoo:

 emerge -av libsdl2 sdl2-image sdl2-mixer sdl2-ttf

(Make sure sdl2-mixer has the mp3 USE flag enabled)

Debian/Ubuntu:

 apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev

Then:

git clone https://github.com/renpy/pygame_sdl2.git
cd pygame_sdl2
python3 setup.py build
python3 setup.py install --user

If using OSX and brew, skip --user.

If you want to use pybox2d, install it exactly the same as way as
pygame_sdl2 but with this repo:

 https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d.git

As of this writing the pips for pygame_sdl2/pybox2d are not up to date
(swig problem). This might get fixed in the future, then you can use pip
instead.
